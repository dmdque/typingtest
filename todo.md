To Do
====
## Probably Do
* make time more precise

  * track scores over time (for each sentence? hmm nah) and make a graph
  * save overall highscore to file
  * print success message when new highscore
* option to choose number of lines to be tested on

## Maybe Do
* graphics
* perhaps change line delimiter from "\n" to "\\" or something

* add comments (#)
